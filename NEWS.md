flux-core version 0.38.0 - 2022-04-04
-------------------------------------

This release makes a few improvements that are visible in the flux-mini(1)
command:

 * The `-N,--nnodes` option may be used without the `-n,--nprocs` option.
 * The `--exclusive` option requests the allocation of whole nodes.
 * The `--requires` option requests resources with generic properties.

Additionally, Flux system administrators should be aware of these changes:

 * Named properties may be assigned to resources in the configured R.
 * flux-shutdown(1) is now the preferred way to stop a Flux system instance.
 * The default `archive.dbpath` is now `/var/lib/flux/job-archive.sqlite`.
 * systemd-coredump(8) can now capture a Flux broker core dump.  Consider
   enabling this on the management nodes of early access systems to help
   gather information on critical rank 0 broker failures, should they occur.
 * `flux resource drain` now shows nodes as "draining" if they are still
   running work.
 * Flux may be configured to reject jobs that do not run in a Flux sub-instance.

For more information, see the Flux Administrator's Guide:

https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adminguide.html

also introduced to give a quick review of the start and stop times and
status of the current Flux instance.

System instance users will want to update their configuration files to
set `tbon.tcp_user_timeout` and remove `tbon.keepalive_*`, if present.

flux-core version 0.13.0 - 2019-10-01
-------------------------------------

## Summary:

This version of flux-core enhances the new execution system to near full
functionality, including new tools for job submission, better MPI support,
task and GPU affinity options, and flexible job output handling including
redirection to bypass the KVS. A powerful shell plugin infrastructure allows
execution features to be selectively enabled by users.

See flux-mini(1) for more info on the new job submission interface.

Some deficiencies present in this release:

 * flux job list doesn't show inactive jobs
 * no per-task output redirection
 * output is space-inefficient in KVS (base64 encoding, one commit per line)
 * no stdin redirection
 * need better shell task cleanup and early task exit detection
 * no debugger support (MPIR)

flux-core version 0.12.0 - 2019-08-01
-------------------------------------

## Summary:

This version of flux-core replaces the old execution prototype, "wreck",
with a new job submission and execution protocol. The new system does
not yet have support for all the features of the prototype, however it
is capable of running jobs specified in version 1 jobspec format with
an advanced and performant job submission API.

For early adopters:
 
 * To generate jobspec, see `flux jobspec`
 * To submit jobspec, see `flux job submit`
 * Instead of `flux wreckrun` try `flux srun`
 * Instead of `flux wreck ls` try `flux job list`
 * Instead of `flux wreck kill/cancel` try `flux job kill/cancel`
 * Job events are recorded detailed eventlog, see `flux job eventlog <id>`
 * Experience job synchronization with `flux job wait-event`
 * Attach to submitted jobs with `flux job attach`
 * Want info about a job? Try `flux job info`
 * Waiting for all jobs to complete? Try `flux job drain`

### New Features:

flux-core version 0.3.0 - 2016-04-26
------------------------------------

* Add support for launching Intel MPI, OpenMPI using PMIv1.
  Use the broker circular log buffer for PMI tracing.

* Add flux wreck timing subcommand which prints time from
  - STARTING: reserved->starting
  - RUNNING:  starting->running
  - COMPLETE: running->complete
  - TOTAL:    starting->complete

* Add three "run levels" for Flux jobs:
  1. run rc1 script on rank 0 to load modules, etc.
  2. run the user's initial program
  3. run rc3 script on rank 0 to unload modules, etc.

* Add module status reporting via keepalive messages.
  `flux module list` now reports live module status:
  - I = intializing
  - S = sleeping
  - X = exited
  - R = running
  - F = finalizing

* Conform to RFC 3 change that requires all JSON payloads to use
  objects as the outermost JSON type (no bare arrays for example).

* Add `flux nodeset` utility so scripts can manipulate nodesets.

* Make `flux env` output suitable for use in bash/zsh eval.

* Drop `flux module --direct` option.  Module load/unload/list is
  now always direct between flux-module and broker(s).
  Drop the `modctl` module for distributed module control.

* When a module fails before entering its reactor loop, propagate
  the error back to `flux module load` so the user knows the
  load was not successful.

* Address memory leaks and adjust KVS usage to ameliorate increasing
  broker memory footprint and degrading job throughput when running
  many small jobs back to back.  Active jobs are now stored under
  `lwj-active` to avoid creating excessive versions of the larger `lwj`
  directory as job state is accumulated.

* Bug fixes to `live` (TBON self-healing) module.  The module is no
  longer loaded by default, pending additional work.  `flux up` will
  always report all ranks up when `live` is not loaded.

* Send keepalives on the ring network and log idle peers on TBON
  and ring at `LOG_CRIT` level, where "idle" means no messages in >= 3
  heartbeats.

* Compress large `content-sqlite` blobs with lzo to reduce disk
  utilization.

* KVS improvements:
  - `kvs_put()` follows intermediate symlinks
  - KVS operations bundled within one commit are applied in order
  - add `kvs_copy()` and `kvs_move()` utility functions.

* Configuration is loaded into broker attribute `config` namespace
  rather than KVS, and is no longer inherited from the enclosing instance.

* `flux` command driver usability improvements.

* Flux API improvements including dropping deprecated functions
  and fine tuning some function signatures (users should recompile).

* Build system allows `--with-tcmalloc`, `--with-jemalloc`, and tcmalloc
  heap profiling.

* Fine tuning of log levels and messages.

* Documentation improvements.

* Test suite improvements/fixes.


flux-core version 0.2.0 - 2016-02-16
------------------------------------

* Avoid putting the Flux libpmi.so in the system ld.so path on systems
  where Flux is installed to the default system prefix, as this could
  interfere with MPI runtimes under other resource managers.

* Enable the SQLite backing store for the KVS by default, which
  addresses unchecked memory growth in the rank 0 broker.

* Stability and usability improvements to the flux-hwloc subcommand,
  and resource-hwloc comms module.

* Added the flux-version subcommand.

* Build system fixes.

* Test suite fixes.
