_NOTE: The interfaces of flux-core are being actively developed
and are not yet stable._ The github issue tracker is the primary
way to communicate with the developers.

See also our [Online Documentation](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io).

### flux-core

flux-core implements the communication layer and lowest level
services and interfaces for the Flux resource manager framework.
It consists of a distributed message broker, broker plug-in modules
that implement various distributed services, and an API and set
of utilities to utilize these services.

flux-core is intended to be the first building block used in the
construction of a site-composed Flux resource manager.  Other building
blocks are also in development under the
[flux-framework github organization](https://github.com/flux-framework),
including a fully functional workload
[scheduler](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-sched).

Framework projects use the C4 development model pioneered in
the ZeroMQ project and forked as
[Flux RFC 1](https://flux-framework.rtfd.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_1.html).
Flux licensing and collaboration plans are described in
[Flux RFC 2](https://flux-framework.rtfd.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_2.html).
Protocols and API's used in Flux will be documented as Flux RFC's.

##### Building from Source
```

./configure
make
make check
```

##### VSCode Dev Containers

If you use VSCode we have a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
provided via the assets in [.devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_create-a-devcontainerjson-file).

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand for more information</summary>
You can follow the [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial) where you'll basically
need to:

1. Install Docker, or compatible engine
2. Install the [Development Containers](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

Then you can go to the command palette (View -> Command Palette) and select `Dev Containers: Open Workspace in Container.`
and select your cloned Flux repository root. This will build a development environment from [fluxrm/testenv](https://hub.docker.com/r/fluxrm/testenv/tags)
that are built from [src/test/docker](src/test/docker) (the focal tag) with a few tweaks to add linting and dev tools.

In addition to the usual flux dev requirements, you get:

* bear
* fd
* gdb
* GitHub CLI
* ripgrep
* and several useful vscode extensions in the vscode server instance, pre-configured for lua, c and python in flux-core


You are free to change the base image and rebuild if you need to test on another operating system!
When your container is built, when you open `Terminal -> New Terminal`, surprise! You're
in the container! The dependencies for building Flux are installed. Try building Flux - it will work without a hitch!

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
# This will install in the container!
make install
# This will test in the container!
make check
# If you want a compilation database
make clean
./scripts/generate_compile_commands # this runs `bear make check` by default to generate for all tests as well
```

And try starting flux

```bash
flux start --test-size=4
```

Note that the above assumes installing flux to `/usr/local`. If you install elsewhere, you'll need to adjust your
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or similar. IPython is provided in the container for Python development, along with other linting tools.
If you ever need to rebuild, you can either restart VSCode and open in the same way (and it will give you the option)
or you can do on demand in the command palette with `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container` (with or without cache).

**Important** it's recommended that you commit (or otherwise write to the .git folder) from the outside
of the container. The reason is two-fold - first, if you need to sign your commits, the container doesn't
have access and won't be able to. Second, if you write to .git it will change permissions of the directory.
If you accidentally do this and need to fix, you can run this from your terminal outside of VSCode:

```bash
$ sudo chown -R $USER .git/
# and then commit
```

Hopefully we will find a workaround for this so everything works from inside of a VSCode terminal.
For the time being, make sure you fix permissions and commit from outside the container on your local machine!

#### Bootstrapping a Flux instance

A Flux instance is composed of a set of `flux-broker` processes
that bootstrap via PMI (e.g. under another resource manager), or locally
via the `flux start` command.

No administrator privilege is required to start a Flux instance
as described below.

##### Single node session

To start a Flux instance (size = 8) on the local node for testing:
```
src/cmd/flux start --size 8
```
A shell is spawned that has its environment set up so that Flux
commands can find the message broker socket.  When the shell exits,
the session exits.

##### SLURM session

To start a Flux instance (size = 64) on a cluster using SLURM:
```
srun --pty --mpi=none -N64 src/cmd/flux start
```
The srun --pty option is used to connect to the rank 0 shell.
When you exit this shell, the session terminates.

#### Flux commands

Within a session, the path to the `flux` command associated with the
session broker will be prepended to `PATH`, so use of a relative or
absolute path is no longer necessary.

To see a list of commonly used commands run `flux` with no arguments,
`flux help`, or `flux --help`
```
$ flux help
Usage: flux [OPTIONS] COMMAND ARGS
  -h, --help             Display this message.
  -v, --verbose          Be verbose about environment and command search
  -V, --version          Display command and component versions
  -p, --parent           Set environment of parent instead of current instance

   version            Display flux version information
```

Most of these have UNIX manual pages as `flux-<sub-command>(1)`,
which can also be accessed using `./flux help <sub-command>`.

#### A note about PMI

During launch, Flux brokers use a PMI server provided by the launcher
to exchange network endpoints and other information.  Flux also _provides_
a PMI server embedded in the Flux job shell to support launching parallel
applications such as MPI or subordinate Flux instances.  In both cases,
the PMI version 1 wire protocol is Flux's preferred PMI interface, but
other options are available.

See the [Flux FAQ](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faqs.html)
for more information on debugging and configuring Flux to interoperate with
foreign launchers and different MPI versions.  Open a flux-core issue if
you encounter a situation that is not covered in the FAQ.
