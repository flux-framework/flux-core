:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
flux_shell_plugstack_call - Calls the function referenced by topic.


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/shell.h>

 int flux_shell_plugstack_call (flux_shell_t *shell, 
                                const char *topic, 
                                flux_plugin_arg_t *args);

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The job shell implements a flexible plugin architecture which allows
registration of one or more callback functions on arbitrary topic
names. The stack of functions "listening" on a given topic string is
called the "plugin stack". `flux_shell_plugstack_call()` exports the
ability to call into the plugin stack so that plugins can invoke
callbacks from other plugins.

RETURN VALUE
------------

Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure, setting errno.

ERRORS:
-------
EINVAL:: 
`shell` or `topic` are NULL.
