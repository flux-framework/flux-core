flux_requeue(3)
===============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux_requeue, flux_requeue_nocopy - requeue a message


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

int flux_requeue (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *msg, int flags);

int flux_requeue_nocopy (flux_t *h, flux_msg_t *msg, int flags);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_requeue()` requeues a _msg_ in handle _h_.  The message
can be received with `flux_recv()` as though it arrived from the broker.

`flux_requeue_nocopy()` is identical to `flux_requeue()`, but does not
copy the message_.  It instead takes ownership of the _msg_ passed in
by the caller.

_flags_ must be set to one of the following values:

FLUX_RQ_TAIL::
_msg_ is placed at the tail of the message queue.

FLUX_RQ_TAIL::
_msg_ is placed at the head of the message queue.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_requeue()` and `flux_requeue_nocopy()` return zero on success.
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

ENOMEM::
Out of memory.
