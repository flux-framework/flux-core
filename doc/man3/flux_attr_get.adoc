NAME
----
flux_attr_get, flux_attr_set - get/set Flux broker attributes


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 const char *flux_attr_get (flux_t *h, const char *name);

 int flux_attr_set (flux_t *h, const char *name, const char *val);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Flux broker attributes are both a simple, general-purpose key-value
store with scope limited to the local broker rank, and a method for the
broker to export information needed by Flux comms modules and utilities.

`flux_attr_get()` retrieves the value of the attribute _name_.

Attributes that have the broker tags as _immutable_ are cached automatically
in the flux_t handle.  For example, the "rank" attribute is a frequently
accessed attribute whose value never changes.  It will be cached on the first
access and thereafter does not require an RPC to the broker to access.

`flux_attr_set()` updates the value of attribute _name_ to _val_.
If _name_ is not currently a valid attribute, it is created.
If _val_ is NULL, the attribute is unset.


RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_attr_get()` returns the requested value on success.  On error, NULL
is returned and errno is set appropriately.

`flux_attr_set()` returns zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned
and errno is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

ENOENT::
The requested attribute is invalid or has a NULL value on the broker.

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

EPERM::
Set was attempted on an attribute that is not writable with the
user's credentials.
