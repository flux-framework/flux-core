NAME
----
flux_send - send message using Flux Message Broker


SYNOPSIS
--------
#include <flux/core.h>

int flux_send (flux_t h, const flux_msg_t *msg, int flags);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_send()` sends _msg_ using the Flux Message broker,
previously opened with `flux_open()` on handle _h_.

_flags_ is the logical "or" of zero or more of the following flags:

FLUX_O_TRACE::
Dumps _msg_ to stderr.

FLUX_O_NONBLOCK::
If unable to send, return an error rather than block.

Internally, flags are the logical "or" of _flags_ and the flags provided
to `flux_open()` when the handle was created.

The message type, topic string, and nodeid affect how the message
will be routed by the broker.  These attributes are pre-set in the message.

RETURN VALUE
------------

`flux_send()` returns  zero on success.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno
is set appropriately.


ERRORS
------

ENOSYS::
Handle has no send operation.

EINVAL::
Some arguments were invalid.

EAGAIN::
`FLUX_O_NONBLOCK` was selected and `flux_send()` would block.


EXAMPLES
--------

This example opens the Flux broker and publishes an event message.
