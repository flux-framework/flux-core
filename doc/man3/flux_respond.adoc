NAME
----
flux_respond, flux_respond_pack, flux_respond_raw - respond to a request


SYNOPSIS
--------
 #include <flux/core.h>

 int flux_respond (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *request,
                   int errnum, const char *json_str);

 int flux_respond_pack (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *request,
                        const char *fmt, ...);

 int flux_respond_raw (flux_t *h, const flux_msg_t *request,
                       int errnum, const void *data, int length);


DESCRIPTION
-----------

`flux_respond()`, `flux_respond_pack()`, and `flux_respond_raw()` encode
and send a response message on handle _h_, deriving topic string,
matchtag, and route stack from the provided _request_.

If _errnum_ is non-zero, an error is returned to the sender such that
`flux_rpc_get(3)` or `flux_rpc_get_raw(3)` will fail, with the system
errno set to _errnum_.  Any payload arguments are ignored in this case.

If _json_str_ is non-NULL, `flux_respond()` will send it as the response
payload, otherwise there will be no payload.  Similarly, if _data_ is
non-NULL, `flux_respond_raw()` will send it as the response payload.

`flux_respond_pack()` encodes a response message with a JSON payload,
building the payload using variable arguments with a format string in
the style of jansson's `json_pack()` (used internally).
