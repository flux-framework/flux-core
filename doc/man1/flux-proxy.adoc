NAME
----
flux-proxy - create proxy environment for Flux instance


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *proxy* URI [command [args...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*flux proxy* connects to the Flux instance identified by _URI_,
then spawns a shell with FLUX_URI pointing to a local:// socket
managed by the proxy program.  As long as the shell is running,
the proxy program routes messages between the instance and the
local:// socket.  Once the shell terminates, the proxy program
terminates and removes the socket.

The purpose of *flux proxy* is to allow a connection to be reused,
for example where connection establishment has high latency or
requires authentication.

EXAMPLES
--------

Connect to a job running on the localhost which has a FLUX_URI
of local:///tmp/flux-123456-abcdef/0/local and spawn an interactive
shell:

  $ flux proxy local:///tmp/flux-123456-abcdef/0/local

Connect to the same job remotely on host foo.com:

  $ flux proxy ssh://foo.com/tmp/flux-123456-abcdef/0/local
