NAME
----
flux-content - access content service


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *content* *load* ['--bypass-cache'] 'blobref'

*flux* *content* *store* ['--bypass-cache'] ['--dry-run']

*flux* *content* *flush*

*flux* *content* *dropcache*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Each Flux instance implements an append-only, content addressable
storage service, which stores blobs of arbitrary content under
message digest keys termed "blobrefs".

*flux content store* accepts a blob on standard input, stores it,
and prints the blobref on standard output.

*flux content load* accepts a blobref argument, retrieves the
corresponding blob, and writes it to standard output.

After a store operation completes on any rank, the blob may be
retrieved from any other rank.

The content service includes a cache on each broker which improves
scalability.   The *flux content flush* command initiates store requests
for any dirty entries in the local cache and waits for them to complete.
This is mainly used in testing.  The *flux content dropcache* command
drops all non-essential entries in the local cache; that is, entries
which can be removed without data loss.


OPTIONS
-------
*-b, --bypass-cache*::
Bypass the in-memory cache, and directly access the backing store,
if available (see below).

*-d, --dry-run*::
When used with *flux content store*, the blobref is computed
locally and displayed on standard output, but the blob is not stored.


BACKING STORE
-------------
The rank 0 cache retains all content until a module providing
the "content-backing" service is loaded which can offload content
to some other place.  Examples of modules providing this service
are *content-sqlite* and *content-sophia*.  The *content-sqlite*
module is loaded by default.

Content database files are stored persistently on rank 0 if the
persist-directory broker attribute is set to a directory name for
the session.  Otherwise they are stored in the directory defined
by the scratch-directory attribute and are cleaned up when the
instance terminates.

When one of these modules is loaded, it informs the rank 0
cache of its availability, which triggers the cache to begin
offloading entries.  Once entries are offloaded, they are eligible
for expiration from the rank 0 cache.

If the module is unloaded, its contents are transferred back
to the cache.  This operation may fail if more content has
been stored than can fit in memory, and so is only advisable early
in the life of an instance.


CACHE EXPIRATION
----------------
The parameters affecting local cache expiration may be tuned with
flux-setattr(1):

*content-purge-target-entries*::
The cache is purged to bring the number of cache entries less than
or equal to this value
(default 1048576).

*content-purge-target-size*::
The cache is purged to bring the sum of the size of cached blobs less
than or equal to this value
(default 16777216)

*content-purge-old-entry*::
Only entries that have not been accessed in *old-entry* heartbeat epochs
are eligible for purge (default 5).

*content-purge-large-entry*::
Only entries with blob size greater than or equal to *large-entry* are
purged to reach the size target (default 256).

Expiration becomes active on every heartbeat, when the cache exceeds one
or both of the targets configured above.  Dirty or invalid entries are
not eligible for purge.


CACHE ACCOUNTING
----------------
Some accounting info for the local cache can be viewed with flux-getattr(1):

*content-acct-entries*::
The total number of cache entries.

*content-acct-size*::
The sum of the size of cached blobs.

*content-acct-dirty*::
The number of dirty cache entries.

*content-acct-valid*::
The number of valid cache entries.


CACHE SEMANTICS
---------------
The cache is write-through with respect to the rank 0 cache;
that is, a store operation does not receive a response until it
is valid in the rank 0 cache.

The cache on rank 0 is write-back with respect to the backing store,
if any;  that is, a store operation may receive a response before
it has been stored on the backing store.

The cache is hierarchical.  Rank 0 (the root of the tree based
overlay network) holds all blobs stored in the instance.
Other ranks keep only what a they heuristically determine to
be of benefit.  On ranks > 0, a load operation that cannot be fulfilled
from the local cache is "faulted" in from the level above it.
A store operation that reaches a level that has already cached the
same content is "squashed"; that is, it receives a response without
traveling further up the tree.
