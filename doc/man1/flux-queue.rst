SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **queue** **disable** [*--queue=NAME*] *reason...*

**flux** **queue** **enable** [*--queue=NAME*]

**flux** **queue** **status** [*--queue=NAME*]

**flux** **queue** **stop** [*--queue=NAME*]

**flux** **queue** **start** [*--queue=NAME*]

**flux** **queue** **drain** [*--timeout=DURATION*]

**flux** **queue** **idle** [*--timeout=DURATION*]

**flux** **queue** **list** [-n] [-o FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The ``flux-queue`` command controls Flux job queues.

Normally, Flux has a single anonymous queue, but when queues are
configured, all queues are named.  At this time, the *disable*,
*enable*, *stop*, *start*, and *status* subcommands can be applied to
a single, named queue.  The rest affect all queues.

``flux-queue`` has the following subcommands:

disable
  Prevent jobs from being submitted to the queue, with a reason that is
  shown to submitting users.  If multiple queues are configured, either the
  *--queue* or the *--all* option is required.

enable
  Allow jobs to be submitted to the queue.  If multiple queues are configured,
  either the *--queue* or the *--all* option is required.

status
  Report the current queue status.  If multiple queues are configured,
  all queues are shown unless one is specified with *--queue*.

stop
  Stop allocating resources to jobs.  Pending jobs remain enqueued, and
  running jobs continue to run, but no new jobs are allocated
  resources.  If multiple queues are configured, either the *--queue*
  or the *--all* option is required.

start
  Start allocating resources to jobs.  If multiple queues are
  configured, either the *--queue* or the *--all* option is required.

drain
  Block until all queues become empty.  It is sometimes useful to run after
  ``flux queue disable``, to wait until the system is quiescent and can be
  taken down for maintenance.

idle
  Block until all queues become `idle` (no jobs in RUN or CLEANUP state,
  and no outstanding alloc requests to the scheduler).  It may be useful to run
  after ``flux queue stop`` to wait until the scheduler and execution system
  are quiescent before maintenance involving them.

list
  Show queue defaults and limits. The *-n,--no-header* option suppresses header
  from output, *-o,--format=FORMAT*, customizes output formatting (see below).

OPTIONS
=======

**-h, --help**
   Summarize available options.

**-q, --queue**\ =\ *NAME*
   Select a queue by name.

**-v, --verbose**
   Be chatty.

**--quiet**
   Be taciturn.

**-a, --all**
   Use with *enable*, *disable*, *stop*, or *start* subcommands to
   signify intent to affect all queues, when queues are configured but
   *--queue* is missing.

**--nocheckpoint**
   Use with *stop*, to not checkpoint that a queue has been stopped.
   This is often used when tearing down a flux instance, so that the a
   queue's start state is not assumed to be stopped on a restart.

**--timeout** \ =\ *FSD*
   Limit the time that ``drain`` or ``idle`` will block.

**-n, --no-header**
   Do not output column headers in ``list`` output.

**-o, --format** \ =\ *FORMAT*
   Specify output format in ``list`` using Python's string format syntax.
   See OUTPUT FORMAT below for field names.


OUTPUT FORMAT
=============

The *--format* option can be used to specify an output format using Python's
string format syntax or a defined format by name. For a list of built-in and
configured formats use ``-o help``.  An alternate default format can be set via
the FLUX_QUEUE_LIST_FORMAT_DEFAULT environment variable.  A configuration
snippet for an existing named format may be generated with
``--format=get-config=NAME``.  See :man1:`flux-jobs` *OUTPUT FORMAT* section for
a detailed description of this syntax.

The following field names can be specified:

**queue**
   queue name

**queuem**
   queue name, but default queue is marked up with an asterisk

**defaults.timelimit**
   default timelimit for jobs submitted to the queue

**limits.timelimit**
   max timelimit for jobs submitted to the queue

**limits.range.nnodes**
   range of nodes that can be requested for this queue

**limits.range.ncores**
   range of cores that can be requested for this queue

**limits.range.ngpus**
   range of gpus that can be requested for this queue

**limits.min.nnodes**
   minimum number of nodes that must be requested for this queue

**limits.max.nnodes**
   maximum number of nodes that can be requested for this queue

**limits.min.ncores**
   minimum number of cores that must be requested for this queue

**limits.max.ncores**
   maximum number of cores that can be requested for this queue

**limits.min.ngpus**
   minimum number of gpus that must be requested for this queue

**limits.max.ngpus**
   maximum number of gpus that can be requested for this queue
