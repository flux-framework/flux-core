NAME
----
flux-snoop - watch Flux comms message broker traffic


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *snoop* ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-snoop(1) is a debugging tool that captures and displays
messages routed through a Flux comms message broker instance.

Multipart ZeroMQ messages are displayed separated by a horizontal
bar.  Within that, each message part occupies one line, beginning
with a single character denoting the message type: event 'e', request '>',
or response '<'.  Next, the size of the message part in bytes (decimal)
is shown in brackets.  Finally the message content, truncated for 80-column
display, is shown.  For example, a "kvs.get" request and response look
like this:

 --------------------------------------
 >[002] |3C4ED!A76A7|
 >[007] kvs.get
 >[028] { "conf.live.status": null }
 --------------------------------------
 <[002] |3C4ED!A76A7|
 <[007] kvs.get
 <[080] { "conf.live.status": { "ok": "[0-7]", "fail":...
 --------------------------------------

While a heartbeat event looks like this:

 --------------------------------------
 e[002] hb
 e[015] { "epoch": 19 }
 --------------------------------------

Flux requests consist of a string message part denoting the service
and operation, followed by a payload message part.  Since requests utilize
the ZeroMQ DEALER - ROUTER flow, socket identities of each hop in
the request message's route are prepended as it is routed "upstream" towards
the root of the tree based overlay network.  In flux-snoop(1) output,
these routing frames are compressed into what looks like one message part,
with abbreviated addresses separated by exclamation points, and the number
of hops shown in brackets, not the size.

Flux responses utilize the reverse flow, where routing frames are stripped
off and used to select the next peer, but otherwise have the same structure
as requests.

Flux events consist of a string message part (the topic name) followed by
a payload.  Events use the ZeroMQ PUB - SUB message flow.
