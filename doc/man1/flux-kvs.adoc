NAME
----
flux-kvs - Flux key-value store utility


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *kvs* 'COMMAND' ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Flux key-value store (KVS) is a simple, distributed data storage
service used a building block by other Flux components.
flux-kvs(1) is a command line utility that operates on the KVS.
It is a very thin layer on top of a C API.

The Flux KVS stores values under string keys.  The keys are
hierarchical, using "." as a path separator, analogous to "/"
separated UNIX file paths.  A single "." represents the root directory
of the KVS.

The KVS is distributed among the ranks of a comms session.  Rank 0
is the leader, and other ranks are caching followers.  All writes are flushed
to the leader during a commit operation.  Data is stored in a hash tree
such that every commit results in a new root hash.  Each new root hash
is multicast across the session.  When followers update their root hash,
they atomically update their view to match the leader.  There may be a
delay after a commit while old data is served on a follower that has not yet
updated its root hash, thus the Flux KVS consistency model is "eventually
consistent".  Followers cache data temporally and fault in new data through
their parent in the overlay network.

Different KVS namespaces can be created in which kvs values can be
read from/written to.  By default, all KVS operations operate on the
default KVS namespace "primary".  An alternate namespace can be
specified in most kvs commands via the '--namespace' option, or by
setting the namespace in the environment variable FLUX_KVS_NAMESPACE.

flux-kvs(1) runs a KVS 'COMMAND'.  The possible commands and their
arguments are described below.

COMMANDS
--------
*namespace create* [-o owner] 'name' ['name...']::
Create a new kvs namespace.  User may specify an alternate userid of a
user that owns the namespace via '-o'.  Specifying an alternate owner
would allow a non-instance owner to read/write to a namespace.

*namespace remove* 'name' ['name...']::
Remove a kvs namespace.

*namespace list*::
List all current namespaces and info on each namespace.

*get* [-N ns] [-j|-r|-t] [-a treeobj] [-l] [-W] [-w] [-u] [-A] [-f] [-c count] 'key' ['key...']::
Retrieve the value stored under 'key'.  If nothing has been stored
under 'key', display an error message.  Specify an alternate namespace
to retrieve 'key' from via '-N'.  If no options, value is displayed
with a newline appended (if value length is nonzero).  If '-l', a
'key=' prefix is added. If '-j', value is interpreted as encoded JSON
and formatted accordingly.  If '-r', value is displayed without a
newline.  If '-t', the RFC 11 object is displayed.  '-a treeobj'
causes the lookup to be relative to an RFC 11 snapshot reference.  If
'-W' is specified and a key does not exist, wait until the key has
been created.  If '-w', after the initial value, display the new value
each time the key is written to until interrupted, or if '-c count' is
specified, until 'count' values have been displayed.  If '-u' is
specified, only writes that change the key value will be displayed.
If '-A' is specified, only display appends that occur on a key.
By default, only a direct write to a key is monitored, which may miss
several unique situations, such as the replacement of an entire parent
directory.  The '-f' option can be specified to monitor for many of
these special situations.

*put* [-N ns] [-O|-s] [-j|-r|-t] [-n] [-A] 'key=value' ['key=value...']::
Store 'value' under 'key' and commit it.  Specify an alternate
namespace to commit value(s) via '-N'.  If it already has a value,
overwrite it.  If no options, value is stored directly.  If '-j', it
is first encoded as JSON, then stored.  If '-r' or '-t', the value may
optionally be read from standard input if specified as "-".  If '-r',
the value may include embedded NULL bytes.  If '-t', value is stored
as a RFC 11 object.  '-n' prevents the commit from being merged with
with other contemporaneous commits.  '-A' appends the value to a key
instead of overwriting the value.  Append is incompatible with the -j
option.  After a successful put, '-O' or '-s' can be specified to
output the RFC11 treeobj or root sequence number of the root
containing the put(s).

*ls* [-N ns] [-R] [-d] [-F] [-w COLS] [-1] ['key' ...]::
Display directory referred to by _key_, or "." (root) if unspecified.
Specify an alternate namespace to display via '-N'.  Remaining options are
roughly equivalent to a subset of ls(1) options.  '-R' lists directory
recursively.  '-d' displays directory not its contents.  '-F'
classifies files with one character suffix (. is directory, @ is
symlink).  '-w COLS' sets the terminal width in characters.  '-1'
causes output to be displayed in one column.

*dir* [-N ns] [-R] [-d] [-w COLS] [-a treeobj] ['key']::
Display all keys and their values under the directory 'key'.  Specify
an alternate namespace to display via '-N'.  If 'key' does not exist
or is not a directory, display an error message.  If 'key' is not
provided, "." (root of the namespace) is assumed.  If '-R' is
specified, recursively display keys under subdirectories.  If '-d' is
specified, do not output key values.  Output is truncated to fit the
terminal width.  '-w COLS' sets the terminal width (0=unlimited).  '-a
treeobj' causes the lookup to be relative to an RFC 11 snapshot
reference.

*unlink* [-N ns] [-O|-s] [-R] [-f] 'key' ['key...']::
Remove 'key' from the KVS and commit the change.  Specify an alternate
namespace to commit to via '-N'.  If 'key' represents a directory,
specify '-R' to remove all keys underneath it.  If '-f' is specified,
ignore nonexistent files.  After a successful unlink, '-O' or '-s' can
be specified to output the RFC11 treeobj or root sequence number of
the root containing the unlink(s).

*link* [-N ns] [-T ns] [-O|-s] 'target' 'linkname'::
Create a new name for 'target', similar to a symbolic link, and commit
the change.  'target' does not have to exist.  If 'linkname' exists,
it is overwritten.  Specify an alternate namespace to commit linkname
to via '-N'.  Specify the target's namespace via '-T'.  After a
successfully created link, '-O' or '-s' can be specified to output the
RFC11 treeobj or root sequence number of the root containing the link.

*readlink* [-N ns] [-a treeobj] [ -o | -k ] 'key' ['key...']::
Retrieve the key a link refers to rather than its value, as would be
returned by *get*.  Specify an alternate namespace to retrieve from
via '-N'.  '-a treeobj' causes the lookup to be relative to an RFC 11
snapshot reference.  If the link points to a namespace, the namespace
and key will be output in the format '<namespace>::<key>'.  The '-o'
can be used to only output namespaces and the '-k' can be used to only
output keys.

*mkdir* [-N ns] [-O|-s] 'key' ['key...']::
Create an empty directory and commit the change.  If 'key' exists,
it is overwritten.  Specify an alternate namespace to commit to via
'-N'.  After a successful mkdir, '-O' or '-s' can be specified to
output the RFC11 treeobj or root sequence number of the root
containing the new directory.

*copy* [-S src-ns] [-D dst-ns] 'source' 'destination'::
Copy 'source' key to 'destination' key.  Optionally, specify a source
and/or destination namespace for the 'source' and/or 'destination'
respectively.  If a directory is copied, a new reference is created;
it is unnecessary for *copy* to recurse into 'source'.

*move* [-S src-ns] [-D dst-ns] 'source' 'destination'::
Like *copy*, but 'source' is unlinked after the copy.

*dropcache* [--all]::
Tell the local KVS to drop any cache it is holding.  If '--all' is
specified, send an event across the comms session instructing all KVS
instances to drop their caches.

*version* [-N ns]::
Display the current KVS version, an integer value.  The version starts
at zero and is incremented on each KVS commit.  Note that some commits
may be aggregated for performance and the version will be incremented
once for the aggregation, so it cannot be used as a direct count of
commit requests.  Specify an alternate namespace to retrieve the
version from via '-N'.

*wait* [-N ns] 'version'::
Block until the KVS version reaches 'version' or greater.  A simple form
of synchronization between peers is:  node A puts a value, commits it,
reads version, sends version to node B.  Node B waits for version, gets
value.

*getroot* [-N ns] [-s | -o]::
Retrieve the current KVS root, displaying it as an RFC 11 dirref object.
Specify an alternate namespace to retrieve from via '-N'.  If '-o' is
specified, display the namespace owner.  If '-s' is specified, display
the root sequence number.

*eventlog get* [-N ns] [-w] [-c count] [-u] 'key'::
Display the contents of an RFC 18 KVS eventlog referred to by 'key'.
If '-u' is specified, display the log in raw form.  If '-w' is
specified, after the existing contents have been displayed, the
eventlog is monitored and updates are displayed as they are committed.
This runs until the program is interrupted or an error occurs, unless
the number of events is limited with the '-c' option.  Specify an
alternate namespace to display from via '-N'.

*eventlog append* [-N ns] [-t SECONDS] 'key' 'name' ['context ...']::
Append an event to an RFC 18 KVS eventlog referred to by 'key'.
The event 'name' and optional 'context' are specified on the command line.
The timestamp may optionally be specified with '-t' as decimal seconds since
the UNIX epoch (UTC), otherwise the current wall clock is used.
Specify an alternate namespace to append to via '-N'.
