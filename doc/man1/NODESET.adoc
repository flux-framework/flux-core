A NODESET is a comma separated list of integer ranks.  Ranks may be
listed individually or as a range in the form _l-k_ where l < k.

Some examples of nodesets. 

[horizontal]
``1'':: rank 1
``0-3'':: ranks 0, 1, 2, and 3 listed in a range
``0,1,2,3'':: ranks 0, 1, 2, and 3 listed individually
``2,5'':: ranks 2 and 5
``2,4-5'':: ranks 2, 4, and 5

As a special case, the string ``_all_'' can be specified to indicate every
rank available in the flux instance.
