FLUX-MODULE(1)
==============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-module - manage Flux extension modules


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *module* 'COMMAND' ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-module(1) manages dynamically loadable Flux modules.
It can load/remove/list modules for the flux-broker(1), and for other
Flux services that support dynamic module extensions.


COMMANDS
--------
*info* ['OPTIONS'] ['name']::
Display information about module 'name'.
If 'name' includes a slash '/' character, it is interpreted as a
file path, and the module name is then determined by reading the
*mod_name* symbol.  Otherwise, FLUX_MODPATH is searched for a module
with *mod_name* equal to 'name'.

*load* ['OPTIONS'] 'name' ['module-arguments' ...]::
Load module 'name',  interpreted as described above.
The service that will load the module is inferred
from the module name.  When the load command completes successfully,
the new module is ready to accept messages on all targeted ranks.

*remove* ['OPTIONS'] 'name'::
Remove module 'name'.  The service that will unload the module is
inferred from the name specified on the command line.

*list* ['OPTIONS'] ['service']::
List modules loaded by 'service', or by flux-broker(1) if 'service' is unspecified.


OPTIONS
-------
*-r, --rank*=['all'|'nodeset']::
Specify which ranks to apply the command to.


LIST OUTPUT
-----------

The 'list' command displays one line for each unique (as determined by
SHA1 hash) module loaded by a service.

*Module*::
The value of the *mod_name* symbol for this module.

*Size*::
The size in bytes of the module .so file.

*Digest*::
The last 7 characters of the SHA1 digest of the contents of
the module .so file.

*Idle*::
Idle times are defined for flux-broker(1) comms modules as the number of
heartbeats since the module last sent a request or response message.
The idle time may be defined differently for other services, or have no
meaning.  When a set of results from multiple ranks is reduced to one
line, the lowest idle time in the set is reported.

*Nodeset*::
The set of ranks that this line applies to.


MODULE SYMBOLS
--------------
All Flux modules define the following global symbols:

*const char *mod_name;*::
A null-terminated string defining the module name.
Module names are words delimited by periods, with the service that
will load the module indicated by the words that prefix the final one.
If there is no prefix, the module is loaded by flux-broker(1).

*int mod_main (void *context, int argc, char **argv);*::
An entry function.
