SYNOPSIS
========

**flux** **filemap** **map** [*--tags=LIST*] [*-C DIR*] *PATH* ...

**flux** **filemap** **unmap** [*--tags=LIST*]

**flux** **filemap** **list** [*--tags=LIST*] [*--long*] [*PATTERN*]

**flux** **filemap** **get** [*--tags=LIST*] [*-C DIR*] [*PATTERN*]


DESCRIPTION
===========

``flux-filemap`` uses :linux:man2:`mmap` to map files into the rank 0 broker
*content cache*.  After mapping, the files may be extracted on any broker rank,
taking advantage of scalability properties of the distributed cache to move the
data.  The files are treated as read-only and must not change while mapped.

``flux-filemap map`` maps one or more file *PATH* arguments.  It must be run
on the rank 0 broker, such as within a batch script, and the files must be
directly accessible by the rank 0 broker.  If a PATH refers to a directory,
the directory is recursively mapped.  If a file is encountered that is not
readable, or has a type other than regular file, directory, or symbolic link,
a fatal error occurs.  Sparse files such as file system images for virtual
machines are mapped efficiently.  File discretionary access permission are
preserved, but file attributes, ACLs, and group ownership are not.

``flux-filemap list`` lists mapped files.  Optionally, a :man7:`glob` pattern
may be specified to filter the list.

``flux-filemap get`` extracts mapped files and may be run on any broker or
across all brokers using :man1:`flux-exec`.  Optionally, a :man7:`glob` pattern
may be specified to filter the list.  When extracting mapped files in parallel,
take care to specify a *--directory* that is not shared and is not on a network
file system without considering the ramifications.

``flux-filemap unmap`` unmaps mapped files.

The ``stage-in`` shell plugin described in :man1:`flux-shell` may be used to
extract previously mapped files into $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR or another directory.

OPTIONS
=======

**-h, --help**
   Display options and exit

**-T, --tags=LIST**
   Specify a comma separated list of *tags*.  If no tags are specified,
   the *main* tag is assumed.

**-C, --directory=DIR**
   Change to the specified directory before performing the operation
   (*map* and *get* subcommands only).

**-v, --verbose=[LEVEL]**
   Increase output verbosity (*map* and *get* subcommands only).

**-l, --long**
   Include more detail in file listing (*list* subcommand only).

**--small-file-threshold=N**
   Set the threshold in bytes over which a regular file is mapped through
   the distributed content cache. Set to 0 to always use the content cache.
   N may be specified as a floating point number with multiplicative suffix
   k,K=1024, M=1024\*1024, or G=1024\*1024\*1024 up to ``INT_MAX``.
   The default is 4K (*map* subcommand only).

**--disable-mmap**
   Never map a regular file through the distributed content cache.

**--chunksize=N**
   Limit the content mapped blob size to N bytes.  Set to 0 for unlimited.
   N may be specified as a floating point number with multiplicative suffix
   k,K=1024, M=1024\*1024, or G=1024\*1024\*1024 up to ``INT_MAX``.
   The default is 1M (*map* subcommand only).

**--direct**
   Avoid indirection through the content cache when fetching the top level
   data for each file.  This may be fastest for a single or small number of
   clients, but will scale poorly when performed in parallel (*get* subcommand
   only).

**--blobref**
   List blobrefs (*list* subcommand only).

**--raw**
   List RFC 37 file system objects (*list* subcommand only).

EXAMPLE
=======

Example 1:  a batch script that copies data from ``/project/dataset1`` to a
temporary directory on each node of the batch allocation where it can be used
by multiple jobs.

.. code-block:: console

  #!/bin/bash

  flux filemap map -C /project dataset1
  flux exec -r all mkdir -p /tmp/project
  flux exec -r all flux filemap get -C /tmp/project

  # app1 and app2 have access to local copy of dataset1
  flux run -N1024 app1 --input /tmp/project/dataset1
  flux run -N1024 app2 --input /tmp/project/dataset1

  # clean up
  flux exec -r all rm -rf /tmp/project
  flux filemap unmap

Example 2: a batch script that maps two data sets with tags, then uses the
``stage-in`` shell plugin to selectively copy them to $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR,
which is automatically cleaned up after each job.

.. code-block:: console

  #!/bin/bash

  flux filemap map --tags=ds1 -C /project dataset1
  flux filemap map --tags=ds2 -C /project dataset2

  # App0 uses $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR/dataset1 and $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR/dataset2
  flux run -N1024 -o stage-in.tags=ds1,ds2 App0

  # App1 uses only $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR/dataset1
  flux run -N1024 -o stage-in.tags=ds1 App1

  # App2 uses only $FLUX_JOB_TMPDIR/dataset2
  flux run -N1024 -o stage-in.tags=ds2 App2

  # clean up
  flux filemap unmap --tags=ds1,ds2

CAVEATS
=======

The rank 0 Flux broker may die with a SIGBUS error if a mapped file is removed
or truncated, and subsequently accessed, since that renders pages mapped into
the brokers address space invalid.

If mapped file content changes, access may fail if the original data is not
cached.  Under no circumstances will the new content be returned.
