FLUX-START(1)
=============
:doctype: manpage


NAME
----
flux-start - bootstrap a local Flux instance


SYNOPSIS
--------
*flux* *start* ['OPTIONS'] [initial-program [args...]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
flux-start(1) launches a new Flux instance.  If a size other than
one is specified on the command line, it is assumed that an
instance of that size is to be started on the local host
with flux-start as the parent.

If size is one (the default), flux-start execs a single flux-broker(1)
directly.  If a PMI environment is available, flux-broker will
use it to fetch job information and bootstrap a session of geometry
determined from PMI.  If PMI is unavailable, flux-broker will run
as a standalone, single-rank job.

A failure of the initial program (such as non-zero exit code)
causes flux-start to exit with a non-zero exit code.

Note: in order to launch a Flux instance, you must have generated
long-term CURVE keys using flux-keygen(1).

OPTIONS
-------
*-s, --size*='N'::
Set the size of the instance (number of message broker ranks).
The default is 1.

*-o, --broker-opts*='option_string'::
Add options to the message broker daemon, separated by commas.

*-v, --verbose*::
Display commands before executing them.

*-X, --noexec*::
Don't execute anything.  This option is most useful with -v.

EXAMPLES
--------

Launch an 8-way Flux instance with an interactive shell
as the initial program and all logs output to stderr:

  flux start -s8 -o,log-stderr-level=7

Launch an 8-way Flux instance within a slurm job, with an interactive
shell as the initial program:

  srun -pty -N8 flux start

Launch an 8-way Flux instance under Flux, with /bin/true as
the initial program:

  flux wreckrun -N8 flux start /bin/true
