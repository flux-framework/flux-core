EXIT STATUS
===========

The job exit status, normally the largest task exit status, is stored
in the KVS. If one or more tasks are terminated with a signal,
the job exit status is 128+signo.

The ``flux-job attach`` command exits with the job exit status.

In addition, ``flux-mini run`` runs until the job completes and exits
with the job exit status.
