Systemd Execution Module
########################

The sdexec broker module implements the ``sdexec`` subprocess service,
an alternative to the built-in ``rexec`` service.  It processes
``sdexec.exec`` requests from job-exec and manages the full lifecycle
of a transient systemd unit for each request.  One instance runs per
broker rank.

sdexec uses the libsdexec library and the :doc:`sdbus` module to
communicate with systemd.

Per-process State (``struct sdproc``)
======================================

Each exec request creates an ``sdproc`` that holds:

- the original request message
- the command JSON object
- futures for start, stop, and property-watch RPCs
- a ``struct unit`` tracking current unit state
- three ``struct channel`` instances for stdin, stdout, and stderr
- stop timer state for kill escalation
- response-sent flags to prevent duplicate responses

Unit Naming
===========

Each transient unit is given a unique name derived from a UUID, with the
Flux job ID embedded for observability.  The name has a ``.service`` suffix
as required by systemd.

I/O Channels
============

Three :linux:man2:`socketpair` channels are created before the unit is started:

- *in* (stdin) — written by sdexec from incoming write RPCs
- *out* (stdout) — read by sdexec; data forwarded as streaming responses
- *err* (stderr) — read by sdexec; data forwarded as streaming responses

The file descriptors for the systemd side of each pair are passed to
``sdexec_start_transient_unit()`` as the ``stdin_fd``, ``stdout_fd``, and
``stderr_fd`` arguments, and are transmitted to systemd as D-Bus file handle
(``h``) typed arguments in ``StartTransientUnit``.  The Flux side FDs are
retained for reading (stdout/stderr) and writing (stdin).

Both stdout and stderr channels are line-buffered by default (``CHANNEL_LINEBUF``).
When systemd closes its end of a channel upon unit exit, the Flux side sees
EOF.  sdexec waits for both stdout and stderr to reach EOF before sending the
final ``ENODATA`` response that closes the exec stream.

Output data is encoded using ``libioencode`` (stream name + rank + data) and
sent as streaming RPC responses.

Unit Lifecycle
==============

After calling ``sdexec_start_transient_unit()``, sdexec subscribes to
``PropertiesChanged`` signals on the unit's D-Bus object path.  The
following state transitions drive the response protocol:

ACTIVE / RUNNING with ExecMainPID set
   Send started response with PID.

ACTIVE / EXITED with ExecMainCode available
   Send finished response with wait status; call StopUnit.

FAILED
   Send error response with systemd result code.

After ``StopUnit`` is called, sdexec waits for stdout and stderr to reach EOF,
then sends ``ENODATA`` to close the exec stream.

Stop Timer and Kill Escalation
===============================

If a process does not exit on its own, the stop timer provides SIGTERM-to-SIGKILL
escalation:

1. When the unit enters DEACTIVATING state, the stop timer is armed
   (disabled by default; configured by ``kill-timeout`` in
   :man5:`flux-config-exec`).
2. On first expiry: ``KillUnit`` with SIGTERM is sent; timer is reset.
3. On second expiry: ``KillUnit`` with SIGKILL is sent; timer is reset.
4. On third expiry: the request is failed with ``EDEADLK``.
