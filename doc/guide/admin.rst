Flux Administrator's Guide
##########################

The *Flux Administrator's Guide* is for system installations of Flux
as the native workload manager on an HPC cluster.  You are a system
administrator.  This document assumes:

- Flux packages are available for your operating system.

- Best practices for configuration management are followed.

This document does *not* apply to getting Flux running as a portability
layer or job step manager.  That's far easier and covered, for example,
in :ref:`start_slurm`.
