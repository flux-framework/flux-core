flux-broker-attributes - overview Flux broker attributes


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Flux broker attributes are parameters that affect how different
broker systems behave.  Attributes can be listed and manipulated
with flux-getattr(1), flux-setattr(1), and flux-lsattr(1).

The broker currently exports the following attributes:

SESSION ATTRIBUTES
------------------

rank::
The rank of the local broker.

size::
The number of ranks in the comms session.

session-id::
The identity of the comms session.

tbon-arity::
The branching factor of the tree based overlay network.

scratch-directory::
A temporary directory available for scratch storage within
the session.  This directory _may_ be shared by multiple ranks.
Cleanup of directory contents is the responsibility of
the creator.

scratch-directory-rank::
A temporary directory available for scratch storage within
the session.  This directory is unique to the local rank,
and is usually a sub-directory of scratch-directory.
Cleanup of directory contents is the responsibility of
the creator.

persist-directory::
A persistent directory available for storage on rank 0 only.
If persist-directory is not defined, persistence is unavailable
and users should fall back to scratch-directory, with cleanup.

persist-filesystem::
If defined, and persist-directory is not defined, the rank
0 broker chooses a unique name for persist-directory within
persist-filesystem and creates it automatically.


SOCKET ATTRIBUTES
-----------------

tbon-parent-uri::
The URI of the ZeroMQ endpoint this rank is connected to in the tree
based overlay network.  This attribute will not be set on rank zero.

tbon-request-uri::
The URI of the ZeroMQ endpoint this rank is bound to in the tree
based overlay network.

snoop-uri::
The URI of the ZeroMQ endpoint that flux-snoop(1) should connect
to in order to receive copies of messages passing through the broker.

local-uri::
The Flux URI that should be passed to flux_open(1) to establish
a connection to the local broker rank.

parent-uri::
The Flux URI that should be passed to flux_open(1) to establish
a connection to the enclosing instance.


LOGGING ATTRIBUTES
------------------

log-ring-used::
The number of log entries currently stored in the ring buffer.

log-ring-size::
The maximum number of log entries that can be stored in the ring buffer.

log-count::
The number of log entries ever stored in the ring buffer.

log-forward-level::
Log entries at syslog(3) level at or below this value are forwarded
to rank zero for permanent capture.

log-critical-level::
Log entries at syslog(3) level at or below this value are copied
to stderr on the logging rank, for capture by the enclosing instance.

log-filename::
(rank zero only) If set, session log entries, as filtered by log-forward-level,
are directed to this file.  If unset, but persist-directory is set, log
entries are directed to persist-directory/log.

log-stderr-level::
(rank zero only) Session log entries at syslog(3) level at or below this
value, and as filtered by log-forward-level, are copied to stderr of the
rank zero broker.


CONTENT ATTRIBUTES
------------------
content-acct-dirty::
The number of dirty cache entries on this rank.

content-acct-entries::
The total number of cache entries on this rank.

content-acct-size::
The estimated total size in bytes consumed by cache entries on
this rank, excluding overhead.

content-acct-valid::
The number of valid cache entries on this rank.

content-backing::
The selected backing store, if any.  This attribute is only
set on rank 0 where the content backing store is active.

content-blob-size-limit::
The maximum size of a blob, the basic unit of content storage.

content-flush-batch-count::
The current number of outstanding store requests, either to the
backing store (rank 0) or upstream (rank > 0).

content-flush-batch-limit::
The maximum number of outstanding store requests that will be
initiated when handling a flush or backing store load operation.

content-hash::
The selected hash algorithm, default sha1.

content-purge-large-entry::
When the cache size footprint needs to be reduced, first consider
purging entries of this size or greater.

content-purge-old-entry::
When the cache size footprint needs to be reduced, only consider
purging entries that are older than this number of heartbeats.

content-purge-target-entries::
If possible, the cache size purged periodically so that the total
number of entries stays at or below this value.

content-purge-target-size
If possible, the cache size purged periodically so that the total
size of the cache stays at or below this value.
