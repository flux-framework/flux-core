def memoized_property(fget):
    """
    Return a property attribute for new-style classes that only calls its
    getter on the first access. The result is stored and on subsequent
    accesses is returned, preventing the need to call the getter any more.
    Example::

        >>> class C(object):
        ...     load_name_count = 0
        ...     @memoized_property
        ...     def name(self):
        ...         "name's docstring"
        ...         self.load_name_count += 1
        ...         return "the name"
        >>> c = C()
        >>> c.load_name_count
        0
        >>> c.name
        "the name"
        >>> c.load_name_count
        1
        >>> c.name
        "the name"
        >>> c.load_name_count
