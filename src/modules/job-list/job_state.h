/* To handle the common case of user queries on job state, we will
 * store jobs in three different lists.
 *
 * - pending - these are jobs that have not yet in the RUN state, they
 *   are sorted based on job urgency (highest first), then job
 *   submission time (earlier submission time first).
 * - running - these are jobs that have transitioned to the RUN state.
 *   They are sorted by initial run start time (later run start
 *   times first).
 * - inactive - these are jobs that are in the INACTIVE state, they
 *   are sorted by job completion time (later completion times
 *   first)
 *
 * There is also an additional list `processing` that stores jobs that
 * cannot yet be stored on one of the lists above.
