/* Waitqueues can be used to stall and restart a message handler.
 * The wait_t contains the message that is being worked on and the
 * message handler callback arguments needed to start the handler over.
 *
 * To stall a message handler, create a wait_t and thread it on one
 * or more waitqueue_t's using wait_addqueue(), then simply abort the
 * handler function.
 *
 * Presumably some other event creates conditions where the handler
 * can be restarted without stalling.
 *
 * When conditions are such that the waiters on a waitqueue_t should
 * try again, run wait_runqueue ().  Once a wait_t is no longer threaded
 * on any waitqueue_t's (its usecount == 0), the handler is restarted.
