/*  Chained futures support: */

/*
 *  Chained futures implementation:
 *
 *  When a chained future is created using flux_future_and_then() or
 *   flux_future_or_then() on a target future f, a chained_future structure
 *   (see below) is created and embedded in the aux data for f. The call
 *   returns an empty "next" future in the chain (cf->next) to the user.
 *   If the user calls both and_then() and or_then(), the same cf->next
 *   future is returned, since only one of these calls will be used.
 *
 *  The underlying then() callback for `f` is subsequently set to use 
 *   chained_continuation() below, which will call `and_then()` on successful
 *   fulfillment of f (aka `prev`) or or_then() on failure. These continuations
 *   are passed `f, arg` as if a normal continuation was used with
 *   flux_future_then(3). These callbacks may use one of 
 *   flux_future_continue(3) or flux_future_continue_error(3) to schedule
 *   fulfillment of the internal `cf->next` future based on a new
 *   intermediate future created during the continuation (e.g. when a
 *   new RPC call is started in the continuation, the future returned by
 *   that call is considered the intermediate future which will eventually
 *   fulfill cf->next).
 *
 *  flux_future_continue(f, f2) works by setting a then() callback
 *   on f to call fulfill_next() on the cf->next embedded in f.
 *   This results in `flux_future_fulfill_with (cf->next, f2)` immediately
 *   when f2 is fulfilled.
 *
 *  If flux_future_continue(3),flux_future_future_continue_error(3) are
 *   not used in the callback, then the default behavior is to immediately
 *   fulfill the next future with the current future. To avoid fulfilling
 *   the next future, e.g. if conditions are not met during multiple
 *   fulfillment, the caller may use flux_future_continue (f, NULL);
 *
 *  All of this simply allows the "next" future returned by and_then()
 *   or or_then() to be a placeholder for a future which can't be
 *   created yet, because it requires the result of a previous, but not
 *   yet complete, operation in the chain.
