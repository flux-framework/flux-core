Release Notes for flux-core version 0.2.0                     16 Feb 2016
=========================================================================

* Avoid putting the Flux libpmi.so in the system ld.so path on systems
  where Flux is installed to the default system prefix, as this could
  interfere with MPI runtimes under other resource managers.

* Enable the SQLite backing store for the KVS by default, which
  addresses unchecked memory growth in the rank 0 broker.

* Stability and usability improvements to the flux-hwloc subcommand,
  and resource-hwloc comms module.

* Added the flux-version subcommand.

* Build system fixes.

* Test suite fixes.
