#  Wrap test_expect_success so we can prepend a custom test-label,

#   _not_ called in expect_success_wrap() because POSIX says:
#
#   "To prevent infinite loops in recursive aliasing, if the shell is
#    not currently processing an alias of the same name, the word shall
#    be replaced by the value of the alias; otherwise, it shall not be
#    replaced."
