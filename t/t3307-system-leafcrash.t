test_description='Hard fail a leaf node and verify transition thru lost

When a leaf node crashes without a chance to notify its parent and then
starts back up, it will try to say hello to its parent as though it were
starting anew.  From the parent perspective, the child may be already
online with a different uuid, so upon receipt of the hello request, it
transitions the child subtree status through lost to fail any pending
RPCs, then proceeds to handle the hello.  This test verifies that the
transition through lost occurs.
