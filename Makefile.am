# Many of flux-core's tests live down in subdirectories with
# the core that that it is testing.  However, some of those tests
# also have dependencies on other subdirectories higher up the
# source tree.  With the recursive Makefiles approach, there is
# no easy way to express that build dependency in a way that will
# actually trigger the build of the that dependency.  The following
# check-local rule, in conjunction with putting "." _first_ in this
# file's SUBDIRS, ensures that "all" is built before any of the
# recursive checks.
